# HelloAcra

> Specify the Acrarium hostname and credentials in `setupAcra()`

Demos the use of [ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra) and [Acrarium](https://github.com/F43nd1r/Acrarium).

It complements the blog "[From ACRA to Acrarium with Traefik and LetsEncrypt along the way](https://medium.com/@francis.meyvis/from-acra-to-acrarium-with-traefik-and-letsencrypt-along-the-way-55177dbd7bb3)".

Enjoy, have fun!
